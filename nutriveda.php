Some critical diseases such as malnutrition are obesity caused by excess energy intake, anaemia is caused by insufficient intake of iron, thyroid deficiency disorders are caused due to deficiency of iodine intake and impaired vision because of inadequate intake amount of Vitamin A, etc.</p>

                                <h5>Importance of good nutrition</h5>

                                <h5>Types of nutrients</h5>

                                <h4>The nutrients are broadly divided into following major categories-Protein </h4>

                                <p>These are made up of chains of amino acids and some of the constituent amino acids of protein are very essential and they cannot be prepared by body itself so it needs to be directly consumed from food. The animal origins of proteins are made cheese fish pottery and these food contains essential amino acids and balanced amount. The plant origin of protein is limited and is loaded with essential amino acids. 1 gram of protein is able to produce 4 kilo calories of energy. </p>

                                <h5>Fat</h5>

                                <p>Fats and oils are very essential source of energy for human body as 1 gram of Fat will provide 9 kilo calories of energy.  Consuming more than twice the energy content of carbohydrates and proteins is in fats and it is essential for many psychological processes why are fatty acids are required</p>


                                <h5>Carbohydrate </h5>

                                <p>These are mostly starches and Sugars of vegetable origin and present and major component of cereals.

The water-soluble vitamin is a group comprising the B-complex vitamin especially thiamine,  riboflavin, niacin and Vitamin C. The food that contains water soluble vitamins are whole cereals, pulses, and vegetables and some animal foods are also rich in B-complex vitamins while fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamin C. Water-soluble vitamins are very easily lost during cooking of food.</p>

                                <p>Fat soluble vitamin are comprised of Vitamin A, D, E, and K which are found in mostly animal food and is very important in emergencies. Vitamin A is also very important for human health as it is actor in maintaining the health of epithelial cells and the stability of member rings and night vision.

Vitamin D is produced in the skin when it gets exposed to sunlight and it is also present in animal and liver of fish.</p>

                                <h5>Minerals</h5>
                                <p>It is one of the important nutrition for body and the most important of minerals are iron, iodine, and zinc to maintain the metabolism of human body. Iron is required for the production of hemoglobin and its deficiency is the common cause of anaemia in many countries including India. Iron is present in good amount especially in fish, red meat, and green leafy vegetables. Similarly iodine is also very important for potty and its deficiency is the cost number of disorders such as hypothyroism, cretinism, mental retardation, goiter, etc. This deficiency can be prevented by simple public health measures such as adding iodized salt in your diet.</p>

                                <h5>Nutritional disorders Protein Energy Malnutrition Marasmus-</h5>

                                <p>It is also known PEM and is more commonly affected children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. It has many short term and long term physical and mental effects such as growth retardation, lowered resistance to infections, increased mortality rates in young children. Two huge forms of protein energy malnutrition are marasmus and kwashiorkor. Marasmus results from starvation from long period of time and the affected child or adult becomes very thin and has most of the fat and muscle mass is expanded to provide energy. This is one of the most frequent forms of protein energy malnutrition conditions of severe food shortage. </p>

Absorption of iron can be greatly improved by consuming foods of animal origin and also by increasing vitamin D content in your diet. The presence of certain substances in cereals and coffee and tea seriously inhibits iron absorption in human body. Coffee and tea contains significant quantities of absorption inheritors and should therefore be drunk at least 2 hours before or after meals rather than with them. Is iron supplementation is reduced then there is deficiency of iron in human body and this condition is known as an anemia. </p>

                                <h5>Iodine deficiency  </h5>

                                <p>Iodine is one of the most important micronutrient. When there is lack of iodine in the diet, it can lead to the iodine deficiency disorders, which can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, brain disorders, and retarded psychomotor development, hearing and speech impairments, and depleted levels of energy in children. This iodine deficiency is the most important and preventable cause of mental retardation across the globe and the diet is likely to be deficient in iodine where ever the soil content of iodine is no such as and mountainous region. Additionally, certain foods contain goitrogens, substances that inhibit iodine absorption and utilization in human body and need to be detoxifies before being consumed.  A simple measure to prevent iodine deficiency disorders is utilizing iodized salt in the diet.</p>

                                <h5>Vitamin A deficiency </h5>

                                <p>Vitamin A deficiency is the world's leading cause of preventable blindness in young children and contributes largely to the high death rates of infants and young children in malnourished communities.  In poor communities, the dietary Vitamin A is derived from yellow vegetables and fruits, and green vegetables and fruits, including dark green leafy vegetables, carrots, mangoes, pumpkins, and papayas, and red palm oil is particularly rich source of vitamin A. The main preventive measures to reduce the vitamin E deficiency in human body are taking high dose supplementation of vitamin A, measles immunization, encouragement of breastfeeding which should be continued during sickness of children, especially in diarrhea,  promotion of local production marketing and consumption of green leafy vegetables and yellow vegetables and fruits and consumption of animal products rich in vitamin A, foods fortified with Vitamin A, environmental sanitation, and personal hygiene measures, especially to prevent diarrheal disease, etc.</p>
